	 		<p>After so many years,Cyprus finally has created its own national Artistic swimming team!The team is located in Larnaca district,and it is a N.O.L.A "sport".Artistic swimming (formally synchro) is a hybrid form of swimming, gymnastics, and dance consisting of swimmers performing a synchronized routine of complex and dynamic underwater movements (known as figures) and arm movements in the water accompanied by music.For the last 5 years,Cyprus is lucky to have a Hard-working team which eventhough is new, has participted already in many competitions;EVEN the International World Aquatics Competition in Athens in 2023<p></p>
